Error fix due to Gitpod change
If you get the following error after typing psql in the terminal:

psql: error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory

Please use the following command in the terminal to set an environment variable needed for it to work:

set_pg

And then try the psql command again

You will need to do this each time you return to your Gitpod workspace for the Database Management Systems videos.
