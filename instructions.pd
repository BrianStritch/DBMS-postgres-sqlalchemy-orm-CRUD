Error fix due to Gitpod change
If you get the following error after typing psql in the terminal:

psql: error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory

Please use the following command in the terminal to set an environment variable needed for it to work:

set_pg

And then try the psql command again

You will need to do this each time you return to your Gitpod workspace for the Database Management Systems videos.

__instructions and commands__

1. To view, or list, any databases in our environment, we can type \l.

2. to cvreate a new database , type , CREATE DATABASE chinook;

3.  the standard way to separate each SQL statement is by adding a semicolon at the end of the statement, since you can theoretically
combine multiple commands in a single entry.

4. If we needed to switch between databases, we can simply type \c followed by the name
of the database we want to switch over to.
\c postgres - now we're on the default postgres database.
\c chinook - and now we're connected to our new database.
The \c stands for 'connect' in case you're wondering, telling it which database to connect to.

5. to install the downloaded sample Chinook PostgreSQL database.
you use : \i Chinook_PostgreSql.sql The \i generally means include, integrate, install, or initialize.

6.
